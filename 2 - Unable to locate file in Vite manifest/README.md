The error:

```
Unable to locate file in Vite manifest: resources/sass/app.scss.
```

means that Laravel is trying to load `resources/sass/app.scss` via Vite, but that file either doesn't exist or hasn't been compiled.

---

### âœ… Fix Steps

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Check if the file exists**

Make sure you have this file:

```
resources/sass/app.scss
```

If it doesn't exist, you can create it manually or change the path in your Vite config.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Update `vite.config.js`**

If you're not using `resources/sass/app.scss`, but instead using a different SCSS or CSS file (like `resources/css/app.css` or `resources/scss/app.scss`), then edit `vite.config.js`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: [
                'resources/css/app.css', // or your actual path
                'resources/js/app.js',
            ],
            refresh: true,
        }),
    ],
});
```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Compile Assets with Vite**

After fixing the file or config, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This will regenerate the `public/build/manifest.json` with correct entries.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Update `app.blade.php` or layout**

If you were referencing `@vite('resources/sass/app.scss')`, update it to match the correct path:

```blade
@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
```

Or if you're using SCSS:

```blade
@vite(['resources/scss/app.scss', 'resources/js/app.js'])
```

---

### âœ… Summary

* Check if `resources/sass/app.scss` actually exists.
* If not, either create it or fix the path in `vite.config.js` and `@vite()`.
* Recompile assets with `npm run dev`.

Let me know if you're using Tailwind, Bootstrap, or another CSS setup and I can tailor it further.
